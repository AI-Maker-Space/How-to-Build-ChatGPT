        "\n",
        "### 🎯 What We Built\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Calendar Integration** - Connected to Google Calendar via MCP connectors\n",
        "- **Multi-Agent System** - Orchestrated 4 specialized agents working together\n",
        "- **Parallel Processing** - Efficient research using async/await patterns\n",
        "- **Structured Outputs** - Type-safe results using Pydantic models\n",
        "- **Streaming Support** - Real-time updates for better user experience\n",
        "- **Customization** - Specialized agents for different meeting types\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔧 Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Calendar Agent** - Fetches events from Google Calendar\n",
        "2. **Event Analyzer** - Determines research needs for each event\n",
        "3. **Research Agent** - Performs web searches on relevant topics\n",
        "4. **Preparation Guide Agent** - Synthesizes findings into actionable guides\n",
        "5. **Orchestrator** - Coordinates the entire workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "### 💡 Best Practices Demonstrated\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Separation of Concerns** - Each agent has a specific, focused role\n",
        "- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks when research fails\n",
        "- **Performance Optimization** - Parallel research queries\n",
        "- **User Experience** - Clear progress indicators and streaming\n",
        "- **Flexibility** - Easy to extend with new agents or tools\n",
        "\n",
