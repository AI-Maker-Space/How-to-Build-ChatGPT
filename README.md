# How to Build ChatGPT

Welcome to a new series! In How to Build ChatGPT, you’ll learn step-by-step everything you need to build your very own ChatGPT application.

​This will include the following topics/sessions:

1. ​Prompting / Open AI Responses API
​2. RAG / Connectors & Data Sources
3. ​Agents / Search
4. ​End-to-End Application / Vibe-Coding the Front End & Deploying the Back-End
5. ​Reasoning / Thinking
6. ​Deep Research
7. ​Agent Mode

​Each of these features is required to build our very own ChatGPT application.

​Nearly three years ago, ChatGPT was released to the world - it was the fastest-growing app the world had ever seen. At the time, it was just an LLM with a front end.

​Now, it’s so much more.

​Meanwhile, nearly three years later in 2025, GPT-5 was recently released on the heels of gpt-oss, the first open-weight model release since GPT-2 in 2019.

​We intend to follow the journey that the OpenAI product team has taken.

​For aspiring AI Engineers, we believe that taking this approach to learning might be one of the best ways to learn to build 🏗️, ship 🚢, and share 🚀 customized production LLM applications for many use cases.

​🛣️ Join us for the entire journey!
